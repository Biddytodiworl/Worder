# Worder

## What is Worder?
Worder is a learning application written in C geared towards improving
proficiency in French. It tests the user's knowledge on many foreign
words. The user responds and gains points on right answers and no points
on wrong answers.

Worder stores a large database of words on disk. More can be added if desired.
The program linearly selects a word from disk and poses it to the user. It then
moves on to the next word, giving 300 points on a correct answer and none if
the answer is incorrect.

## Building

### Windows

To install Worder on Windows, you must first install [Cmake](https://cmake.org) and
a form of the GCC C Compiler, such as [MinGW](http://mingw.org). Follow the
instructions in the Makefile to build the application.

This is as much information as you need. I just wanted to start you off with the
software. Sooner or later, you will read the source code. Enjoy the application!
